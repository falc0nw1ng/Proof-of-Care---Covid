**** NOTE: This was a small COVID tracker I made for Proof of Care while working there. Ultimately there wasn't enough views on it to justify the Heroku server but nevertheless it is here. The app tracks covid-19 in the BC region and pulls data from the bccdc website. The application was made to be embedded in a webage.


** legacy notes
The data is seperated into six regions. They are:

Fraser, Vancouver Coastal, Interior, Northern, Vancouver Island, Out of Canada

The main one we are interested in however is Vancouver Coastal as this is the region that includes the main city of Vancouver, Richmond and North Van.

The second most important is Fraser. This includes most of the lower mainland as well as populated areas such as Surrey and Burnaby



for data source, the spatial data source for GIS/data science set does not work. This gives a summary of the 5 regions in BC

the case data for csv works well but not sure how to interact with it

laboratory data gives testing data. for things like how many tests, positive tests and turn arounds
